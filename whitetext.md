<!--
I can’t, and won’t ever be able to, get enough of you.
It's wonderful to have you

<font color="#ffffff">

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day  <p>
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away  <p>
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through  <p>
 t's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you  <p>


And can you feel the love tonight?  <p>
I  is where we are  <p>
It s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  <p>
That we got thi  far  <p>


And can you feel the love tonight?  <p>
Ho  it's laid to rest  <p>
It's en ugh to make kings a d vagabon s  <p>
B lieve the ve y best  <p>


There's a time  or everyone if they only learn  <p>
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in t rn  <p>
There's a rhyme and reason to the wi d outdoors  <p>
When the heart of this s ar-cr ssed voyager beats in time with yours <p>


And can you feel the love tonig t? <p>
It is where we  re <p>
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer <p>
That we got this far <p>


And can you feel the love tonight? <p>
How it's laid to rest <p>
It's enough to make kings and  agabonds <p>
Believe the ver  best <p>


It's en  gh to make kings and vagabonds <p>
Believe the very best <p>
