	There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
	When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
	An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
	 t's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you


	And can you feel the love tonight? 
	I  is where we are
	It s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
	That we got thi  far


	And can you feel the love tonight?
	Ho  it's laid to rest
	It's en ugh to make kings a d vagabon s
	B lieve the ve y best


	There's a time  or everyone if they only learn
	That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in t rn
	There's a rhyme and reason to the wi d outdoors
	When the heart of this s ar-cr ssed voyager beats in time with yours


	And can you feel the love tonig t?
	It is where we  re
	It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
	That we got this far


	And can you feel the love tonight?
	How it's laid to rest
	It's enough to make kings and  agabonds
	B lieve the ver  best


	It's en  gh to make kings and vagabonds
	Believe the very best
