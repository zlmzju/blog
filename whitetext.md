<p>There's a calm surrender to the rush of day </p>
<p>When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away </p>
<p>An enchanted moment, and it sees me through </p>
<p> t's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And can you feel the love tonight?  </p>
<p>I  is where we are </p>
<p>It s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer </p>
<p>That we got thi  far </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And can you feel the love tonight? </p>
<p>Ho  it's laid to rest </p>
<p>It's en ugh to make kings a d vagabon s </p>
<p>B lieve the ve y best </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There's a time  or everyone if they only learn </p>
<p>That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in t rn </p>
<p>There's a rhyme and reason to the wi d outdoors </p>
<p>When the heart of this s ar-cr ssed voyager beats in time with yours</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And can you feel the love tonig t? </p>
<p>It is where we  re</p>
<p>It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer</p>
<p>That we got this far</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And can you feel the love tonight?</p>
<p>How it's laid to rest</p>
<p>It's enough to make kings and  agabonds</p>
<p>Believe the ver  best</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It's en  gh to make kings and vagabonds</p>
<p>Believe the very best</p>
